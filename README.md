# **Task 1: software configuration.**

# **Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?**

I decided to participate in the project because I want to develop myself and learn new things plus I want to do in parallel QA testing.

I expect the most from the project because I want to seriously engage in QA testing and practice and raise my skills.ðŸ˜€
